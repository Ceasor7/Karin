            Who i am
        </nav>

        <article>
            I am Karin Waidley, a passionate and versatile professional deeply immersed in the world of theatre,
            education, and scholarly pursuits. Rooted in a commitment to using the transformative power of theatre
            for
            social change, I've dedicated my career to fostering understanding and addressing critical issues,
            particularly in the realm of violence prevention. With a foundation in both performance and academia, I
            bring a unique perspective to my work, seeking to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

            What i do
        </nav>

        <article>
            In the dynamic intersection of teaching, artistry, and scholarship, I craft narratives and experiences
            that
            resonate on both personal and societal levels. My professional journey encompasses founding and
            directing
            impactful theatre programs, both locally and internationally, and spearheading initiatives that harness
            the
            potential of theatre for social justice. As a Resident Dramaturg at the University of Michigan and
            through
            collaborative projects with Kenyan artists, I continue to direct, dramaturg, and engage in research that
            explores the intricate connections between storytelling, embodied performance, and the neurobiology of
            trauma.

            My Values
        </nav>

        <article>
            At the core of my professional ethos lies a commitment to using theatre as a catalyst for positive
            change.
            My values are rooted in social justice, education, and community engagement. I believe in the power of
            storytelling and embodied performance to not only entertain but also to create empathetic understanding
            and
            address societal challenges. Collaborative, innovative, and socially conscious, I strive to infuse my
            work
            with these values, whether directing a play, leading educational initiatives, or contributing to
            scholarly
            publications.
